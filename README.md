# Courage

## Value

Courage is a unique journalling experience meant to fortify your ability to face rejection. Log every time you leave your comfort zone and boldly ask. Whether it's a date with a girl you liked for ages, or requesting a raise, or even an extra scoop of rice in your Chipotle burrito bowl. Keep track of it in Courage.
